This way it’s:  
- Minimal, no unnecessary fluff ✅  
- Clean sections (Features, Tech, Setup) ✅  
- Shows off your deployment ✅  
- Branding with your name + portfolio ✅

Do you also want me to **make a matching preview banner image** (like a header image for the repo with your project name + gradient style) so the GitHub repo looks extra polished?
